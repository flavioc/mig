This is GNU MIG, the GNU distribution of the Mach 3.0 Interface Generator
(MIG), <http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/mig/gnu_mig.html>.
Welcome.

This tool translates Remote Procedure Call (RPC) definition files to C
code, and is required to compile any packages that are receiving or
invoking RPCs, such as GNU Mach, GNU Hurd, and the GNU C Library (glibc)
when compiled for the Hurd.

Generic installation instructions may be found in the file `INSTALL'.

NOTE: To compile this distribution, you will need a compilation environment for
the target Mach platform (e.g. the GNU Hurd).  Actually, just a compiler for
the right machine that can find the Mach include files will do (i.e. the
`include/mach' tree installed by the GNU Mach distribution).  If you tell
`configure' to produce a cross-MIG by giving `--target' and `--host' options
that differ, it will attempt to find a compiler for the target; for example,
with the command `configure --host=SOMETHING --target=i586-gnu', it will
automatically try to use `i586-gnu-gcc' for the target compilations.  If you
don't specify `--target', then the native compiler will be used and it must be
able to find a Mach include tree.  You can explicitly set the target compiler
and its `CPPFLAGS' and `CFLAGS' to use by passing `TARGET_CC',
`TARGET_CPPFLAGS' or `TARGET'CFLAGS' to `configure', e.g.:

	`configure TARGET_CC=i586-gnu-gcc' or
	`configure TARGET_CPPFLAGS=-I"$HOME"/some/where/include'
